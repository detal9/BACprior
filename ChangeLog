2025/08/28:
- Minor modifications to DESCRIPTION and documentation files to comply with new CRAN policies.

2023/10/10:
- Minor modifications to DESCRIPTION and documentation files to comply with new CRAN policies.
- Slightly modified the example in BACprior.lm to shorten computing time

2022/05/02:
- Minor modifications to the NAMESPACE file to comply with new CRAN policies.


2014/11/18:
- Added two new functions to select the omega value in an
  attempt to minimize mean squared error: BACprior.CV and BACprior.boot.
- The documentation was updated.


2013/01/22:
- Corrected a bug in BACprior.lm which caused the full model not to be considered. 
  This bug did not return an error message, but results were wrong.
- Corrected a bug in BACprior.lm which occured when only one model received
  all posterior weight. This bug returned an error message and the function did not return
  any results when it occured.
- The results of BACprior.lm incorrectly titled a column as standard deviation (was variance).
  Results now really return posterior standard deviation.
